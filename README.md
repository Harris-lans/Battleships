## Details about the app
This is a Battleships Game with two modes -> Classic and 2Players.

Classic Mode is where the Player shoots squares with limited ammunition and wins if
the player destroys all the randomly placed ships.

2Player Mode is a hot-seat mode where two players play the game. After each turn the Announcer pops up and asks the Player to switch. The players can also view their own map by using the Switch Map Button. When a player destroys all of other player's ships, the player wins. If a player runs out of missiles the player with the most score wins.
